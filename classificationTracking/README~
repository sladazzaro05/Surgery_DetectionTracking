In order to run the code used, the MainRealTime function should be called.

Syntax:
MainRealTime( trainDir, videoPath, vidOutputName, s, widthOfBins, thresh );

where:
trainDir- 	directory of training images.  Note there should be
               		a subdirectory in trainDir which contains .jpg images
videoPath- 	the path to the video to be used for testing
vidOutputName- 	the name of video file to output
s- 		the window size that each frame will be split up in to form
               		histograms (good value to use is 40)
widthOfBins- 	the width of the bins for the RGB color
               		histograms (good value to use is 16)
thresh- 	the cutoff distance threshold used to measure whether
               		or not window histograms are close enough to the training
               		histograms. (good value to use is -6)

NOTE: The first time running the program in a new Matlab window, there will be an overhead time cost as Matlab must create a parallel pool of workers since this program uses the Parallel Computing toolbox.
